page paths are stuck inside the page.Build method (inside vars) and can't be changed. So nested layouts expose layout paths instead of the deep page's path.

page variables are really hackily passed to layouts, and there isn't much transitivity of variables through layout chains.

no work has been put in to making errors consistent and controlled.

variable naming may be inconsistent throughout the code
